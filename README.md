# RNA-seq-TNBC
Analyzing RNA-seq data from Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients to identify highly expressed genes and key pathways, evaluate their clinical relevance through survival analysis, and design potential therapeutic agents.**
## Overview

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a challenging subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. This project aims to discover novel therapeutic targets by integrating transcriptomic data and clinical outcomes.

We present a computational pipeline that:
- Identifies **highly expressed genes** in TNBC patients.
- Maps these genes to **relevant biological pathways**.
- Evaluates their **prognostic value** using survival analysis.
- Guides **drug design strategies** to target key genes and pathways.
